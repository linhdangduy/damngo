## Overview

This is landing page for our upcoming wedding, where we show bride and groom and our families images with wedding information like: words for describing our love so we can entertain people, wedding venue address, date and time, embedded map to show the way to wedding venue, and the place for showing banking QR code of bride and groom so other people can send gifts to us.

## UI/UX

- The website MUST looked so professional, formal, solemn that suitable for wedding ceremonies.
- The users MUST be able to scroll the website vertically, see all the images and wording, wedding venue & date and time information near the beginning of the website.
- Following wedding information is the QR codes of bride and groom with button to open it, not show it directly at the first glance
- Then the remain image can be shown at the end.
- The website MUST be responsive for all screen size: PC, laptop, smart phone with various size, smart television, tablet...
  - But we should limit the width of the website so on large size screen / PC / ipad, the users can see all the information/images easily and don't have to scan from left to right
- The website MUST have smooth transition between pages and images when users scroll down.
- The website MUST be loaded so that users do not have friction during scrolling
- The wording should having lovely wording following all the image I puts in the public/images folder.
- The wording should be in Vietnamese.
- The theme should be in red, like the image with the name public/images/wedding-invitation/outlook-of-wedding-invitation.png

## Coding practice

- We should follow the best practices for HTML, Javascript/Typescript, CSS for the website.
- Please consider using popular and convenient library, package for CSS
- Please make sure the website bring good loading experience for users
- Please follow the best practice for code organization within the project

## Deployment [WIP]
